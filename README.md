HomeAssistant Custom Integration
This repository provides a custom integration for HomeAssistant, enabling you to connect to a system, discover devices, and manage their states. Follow the steps below to develop and set up your own integration.

Overview
This guide outlines the process of creating a HomeAssistant integration by building the necessary files and logic. It’s designed for developers looking to integrate custom devices or systems into HomeAssistant.

Development Steps
1. Set Up the Environment
Reference repository for Device:

https://github.com/home-assistant/example-custom-config.git
Clone this repository and use Example_MQTT for development:

https://github.com/CueHome/Cue-HA-drivers.git
Navigate to custom_components/ in the cloned repository.

2. Create Integration Files
Create a folder for your integration (e.g., my_integration/).

Add these files:

__init__.py: Main entry point.
<device_type>.py: Device-specific logic (e.g., switch.py).
manifest.json: Metadata file.
Example structure:

custom_components/my_integration/
├── __init__.py
├── switch.py
└── manifest.json
3. Implement Connection & Discovery
In __init__.py, add logic to:

Connect to your system (e.g., API or local device).
Discover or fetch devices and store them for later use.
4. Define Device Logic
Create files for each device type (e.g., switch.py, dimmer.py). Define a class per device with:

Control methods (e.g., turn on/off).
State feedback (sync or async).
Compatibility with HomeAssistant entities (e.g., SwitchEntity).
5. Set Up Entry Point
In __init__.py, add:

async def async_setup(hass, config):
    # Initialize services or connections
    return True
For config flow, add:

async def async_setup_entry(hass, entry):
    hass.async_create_task(setup_devices(hass, entry))
    return True
6. Add Device Functionality
In device files (e.g., switch.py), implement methods like:

from homeassistant.components.switch import SwitchEntity

class MySwitch(SwitchEntity):
    def __init__(self, device_id, connection):
        self._device_id = device_id
        self._connection = connection
        self._state = False

    async def async_turn_on(self):
        await self._connection.turn_on(self._device_id)
        self._state = True

    async def async_turn_off(self):
        await self._connection.turn_off(self._device_id)
        self._state = False

    @property
    def is_on(self):
        return self._state
Additional Notes
Manifest File
Define metadata in manifest.json:

{
  "domain": "my_integration",
  "name": "My Custom Integration",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": [],
  "requirements": ["some-library==1.2.3"]
}
Testing
Copy your integration to custom_components/ in a HomeAssistant instance and restart.
Best Practices
Use async/await for compatibility with HomeAssistant’s event loop.
Installation
Clone this repository.
Copy the my_integration/ folder to custom_components/ in your HomeAssistant config directory.
Restart HomeAssistant to load the integration.
